# tr seems to work on systems that don't know the Czech locale, but
# grep does not.  So don't use grep, e.g. to eliminate words
# containing letters not in our alphabet.  Instead, pass the -r flag
# via D2DARGS so they're dropped.

LANGINFO: <p>This BYOD language works on Czech wordlists encoded in
LANGINFO: windows-1250 and produces dictionaries that should work on
LANGINFO: windows-1250-localized systems.  If your Czech wordlist is
LANGINFO: iso-8859-2-encoded, go back and choose Czech-ISO8859-2. </p>
