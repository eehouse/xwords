<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 38 release</b>
<ul>

  <li>Make toolbar buttons slightly wider and the whole thing 
  scroll</li>
  
  <li>Added a wordlist browser, which you can get to by tapping a 
  wordlist in the Wordlist screen, or by using the wordlist 
  button on the game board.  Eventually you'll be 
  able to filter based on length, chosen tiles, etc.  Right now 
  you can scroll through all the words (even 2.7 million of them 
  if you're playing in Polish) and tap to look them up.</li>

  <li>Added the "download directory" to locations I search for 
  wordlists.  This means that if you're using a browser like 
  Opera that doesn't respect apps' registering for certain types 
  of data you can still use a wordlist you've downloaded.</li>

  <li>Added "Pick tiles face up" option, settable when you create a 
  game.  This is primarily useful if you want to populate a board to 
  match a game that already exists, say in a newspaper puzzle or 
  online wordgame.</li>

    TODO: test various bogus dicts in downloads/
          test that opera-downloaded dicts openable/moveable

</ul>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
