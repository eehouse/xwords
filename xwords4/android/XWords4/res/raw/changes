<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 17 release</b>

<p>This release changes how networked games are created, configured 
and connected.  For the most common two player/two device game there's 
a new dialog that asks for the one piece of information that's 
absolutely required: the room name.</p>

<p>I've also scattered "new user hints" around the app, dialogs with 
tips that you can dismiss with a "Do not show again" button when you 
don't need to see that hint again.</p>

<p>The server through which networked games connect has also been 
rewritten, and games created with earlier versions will no longer 
connect.  I appologize to those who cannot finish games, especially if 
you were winning!</p>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Letting me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see is the best way to help get this to release quality 
quickly.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
